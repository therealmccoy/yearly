a.) get started with the work of launching innovation. Even if you haven't mapped out what the next 47 steps look like.

b.) we're not going to plan everything out, rather we're just going to go ahead and get started in some of this work.

c.) It always comes out of partnerships. So who are my partners? Who is it who really shares my passion about something? And then, as you said, you know, right from the beginning, get started.

d.) By the time you sit around and figure it out, you'll have waited way too long you. You figure it out as you go.

e.) But what can we do tomorrow to start bringing about a vision that we come up with together to have there be better teaching and learning for our students?

f.) can be thinking longer term, just don't get hung up because I don't-- as you say, don't have the long-term plan, you never will.

g.) when communities do really great work along these lines, when they're really pulling their oars together towards making some kind of improvement, it tends to be really fun. That's part of what sustains this. Part of the excitement and energy of innovation is it's really fun when you're working together
with colleagues, who care about the same kinds of things that you care about, in part because you've been talking to each other to try to figure out what are these aspirations that we share together.
