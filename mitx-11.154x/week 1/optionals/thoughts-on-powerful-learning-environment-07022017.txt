# these are the notes taken from the optional-to-watch video from assignment 1.1 of week 1 of mitx-11.154x


a.) One is that, when you walk into it,there is a sense of engagement and excitement and purposeful learning.

b.) there is attention given to, not only the content, but what is often referred to as the four Cs--
communication, collaboration, creativity, and critical thinking.

c.) A powerful learning environment is an environment where learning isn't one-sided. Learning is happening in every aspect, every corner,
every facet of what that classroom is. And I think a big part of that is, again, the relationship between a teacher and a student.
And it's also about the fundamental idea of learning, where it's not just about the subject itself. It's about what the subject means to every single person
there.

d.) It's a place where students are getting a lot of feedback regularly from teachers that is fair and precise and actually helps students to make corrections to their learning.

e.) It's an environment that's social.That noise, that productive noise, is really important. It's not that, kind of, students sitting quietly,
listening to the teacher deliver information. It's a setting in which the teacher is more of a facilitator and a guide, and not a giver of information.
But the students are the ones that are actively driving their learning. It's students that are empowered to try new things.
It's not everybody doing the same thing at the same time. If you can, as a teacher, be able to facilitate multiple projects, then that's a powerful learning environment, because it's differentiated and individualized, and all of the students are connecting and liking what they're doing.
