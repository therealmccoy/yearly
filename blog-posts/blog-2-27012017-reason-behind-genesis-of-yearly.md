# Blog 2 - 27th Jan 2017 : The genesis of Yearly

Everything starts with Education, but unfortunately the most broken piece in this world is Education.

Slowly over the years like most of us, I have been realising since completing my formal education, but a couple of months back I had the opportunity to volunteer for an organisation and get to learn deep insights about how actually rotten the entire school system is.

School and Colleges operate as assembly lines manufacturing products, but with one difference, there is no QA department.

We would not buy any product without asking for its warranty or guarantee terms, but here we are willing to risk the best years of our life and our closest ones, on which there is guarantee of return. **It is like handle or enroll at your own risk**

We have no option but to be slave of this system, buy the education through huge loans and financial burden and then join this eternal wait to get a job and start the process of paying back the loan.

College system in India is no better, there are several statistics to prove that, no better than the one which is staring you in the face right now.

Since OCW (Open Courseware of MIT) days, attempt have been made to make education accessible to all. the technology with the advent of better devices and cheaper and wider access to internet has solved the distribution problem to many extent, but the problem of learning which they impart is still the same, decades old, if not centuries.

**Fundamentally, what is being attempted is to get an online replacement or technological replacement of every class-room activity and thus present a course to the students.**

**But, the whole premise is that decades and and centuries old classroom teaching done in most of the education system itself is rotten!**

Technology alone cannot fix education unless there is a paradigm shift made also in parallel to teaching, pedagogy and education methodology.

And technology has not been able to fix the education problem is evident from the data thrown by leading education portals, where people are struggling to complete the courses, more so courses are not being completed by even those people, who have paid for it.

It is exactly mimicking what happens in the offline education system.

And this is mimicking the offline education system results, because the attempt is being made to get everything which is currently being done in the classroom to online, by finding their substitutes.

So classroom tests have been replaced by Quizzes, there are forums which replace discussions.

Everything has been tried to replace, except the teaching methodology.

While it seems that everything is being done in a newer manner in terms of technology, but what about the ways to teach?

**At yearly we believe that the sweet spot of effective teaching lies in the middle!**

>Between MOOC and personalised one-to-one interaction, there is middle sweet-spot of COHORTS

>**Cohorts** are we believe can be massive and personalised enough to be effective.

With one-to-one interaction, there is problem of scale and with MOOCs the problem is of indifference.

It is a classic CATCH-22.

At Yearly, we are attempting to solve this problem with the help of middle sweet-spot called Cohorts.
