# Blog 4 - 30th Jan 2017 : Mobile learning in it's present avatar is vanity.

internet access and mobile have been brought millions to a new form of learning.

in the heydays, when the pioneers considered this approach, the choice was elementary. for hundred of millions of people, the mobile phone has been the first computer that they have bought.

enabling people learn was on this basic premise that this mobile form of computing would allow, those who do not have traditional form of access, a gateless approach.

but the problem which has transcended to grave proportion is the use of $1000 hand-held devices, purely use for the consumption purpose _(answering emails can be discounted to most extent as consumption, except in very rare cases, where replying an email takes the form of a revolutionary new concept or idea).

**learning anything requires deliberate practice and it requires 100% attention and focus.**

**where do you get attention and focus on mobile devices?**

###once the device is connected to internet, there are hundreds of different types of notification from dozens of apps, vying for attention of the student.

there are very few in a million who tend to dis-able all notification from their apps, and there is no study about how sustainably there have been able to do so.

##so how would you learn on a platform which is constantly throwing you out of the learning zone?

    > * employing a different device for learning altogether.
        _not possible in majority of the cases for the reason of affordability_

    > * disabling all notifications.
        _but still they all are sitting right there, and one is bound to slip_

    > * using offline apps for learning.
        _unfortunately when this could have been one solution, most of the apps today do not support offline work._

        _**one way**, probably this could be solved is to let the user download the updated content for that module and then the app dis-connects automatically, and then when the time of submission comes, the app automatically connects to internet. at the time of submission, the student has already finished the course or the quota of learning and there is lesser harm from the swarms of notification descending in few seconds._

#### the true measure of success for a learning app or online learning platform is the number of courses that have been completed or lessons finished or certificates earned, it is about whether the student is being able to employ the knowledge earned in the right way in her life and that lead to an improvement in her life?

#### measuring success of an online learning platform or an app in terms of number of courses finished or lessons completed is just like the school and colleges mentality, wherein the responsibility of the educational institution is over, the moment student graduates form the school. and that is why, **the schools and colleges of today are assembly line for producing degree-holders**, rather than institutions of improving people's life.

surprisingly the desktop/laptop has become a more safer option for online learning now, where the distractions are still there but very limited and can be controlled in a very tight manner.

        _eg: closing off the f***book browser window before commencing online study, compared to at best dis-abling facebook notification, but letting it sit over your mind._

intrinsically there is so much of distraction, information garbage over-load, lack of attention and focus in every-day life that dreaming people would learn something constructively on a mobile device and shall be able to improve their life with it is beyond my comprehension.

#mobile learning at best, in its present avatar, could be a vanity!
