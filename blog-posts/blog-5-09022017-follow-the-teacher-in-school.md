we always tend to miss the woods for the trees and the classic example is what we do to our kids in the school.

all of us want our kids to become successful _(what most of us mean by that term is materialistically, even though it does not count anywhere in the four pillars of life and is a non-useful by-product)_ and for that matter, we force her to go through courses which we in our own blind-spotted view think that would bring her closer to materialistic success.

it is elementary that we can be good at anything if we have the passion and heart in it; and if we are good at something, the smiles of fortune would not be too behind, because being good at something requires putting years behind it diligently and **the law of karma** and **law of conservation of energy** says that, valiant efforts never go in vain.

so essentially if we invert this, the question of materialistic success of the kid lies in, what and who of **putting her heart and passion into something?**

sometimes it is parents, but in today's world where parents have hardly have time to have a proper meal with their kids without the interruption of television or mobile, it is actually too much to ask for!

**so who else?**

bingo... yes, the teacher!

**follow the teacher and not the course or subject**

history is filled with examples that the gift of an inspired teacher is priceless, and even then we never ask our kids in school, that for next two years (+ 2), which teacher would be the one, you would like to learn with?

by that time, students are already aware with the reputation of the teachers around them and if parents are not too busy, they also usually are, but this question is never asked!

what happens is actually, the parents chase the course or the subject label blindly as they do with so many other things, if not the most of the things in life _(the more the prestigious the label is better it is; cars, clothes, accessories, devices etc)_ and then the kid is forced to bear even a mediocre teacher for next two years of her high school.

a mediocre teacher is gifted and potent enough to kill even the strongest desire and passion one can have for a particular subject; while at the same time, a gifted and and inspired teacher can lit the spark and ignite the passion for that subject which she teaches and set her heart for that subject; even in a hibernating kid!

still we follow the course or subject and not the teacher!

what happens next usually, is that, since all interest of the particular subject(s) thrusted upon by the parents on the kids is murdered by that mediocre teacher, the subjects are not learnt or studied but just **gamed** to pass the exam!

one thing leads to another and mediocre things, always leads to mediocre things and ultimately, all we had is a kid with another run-the-mill mediocre career, unlike what could have been the top 1 percentile of careers in the world, if she would have been allowed to follow the teacher, instead of the subject!

**Follow the teacher, and not the course**

_PS: while this is written with the perspective of school, but ti is applicable to all levels of education and it actually happens at all levels. our choices of courses of graduate school, post-graduate school is driven by the choices of in-vogue labels, rather than finding out and following that inspired and gifted teacher._
