# Blog 3 - 27th Jan 2017 : The paradigm shift that is required in online learning

The online learning platforms are doing the same mistake that schools and colleges have been doing since centuries. Trying to fit one standard curriculum for all.

For students, enrolled in schools and colleges, they do not have any other option but to complete the course/curriculum in which they are enrolled because it has come with great cost and it is an entry barrier to anything they wish to do further in life.

It hardly matters, if this education in which they are enrolled is going to benefit in any way, what they want to do eventually.

In the case of online courses, people have a choice, to drop out of course or the MOOC; to not pursue it at all, if they cannot connect with it.

The recent study by Harvard and MIT of their MOOC platform provides ample live data of this phenomena.

**Following startling observations can be made:**

    *Current online education system has failed to change the motive of the student from the college system of earning a degree and certificate. You remove the certificates and there is a drastic drop in enrollment. Status quo of learning and education remains the same.
    * Even of those who have paid for the certificates, only 60% manage to earn it. There was never enough **connect** and **will to learn** to pull them towards the course.

The biggest reason of courses not being completed is for the fact that, these MOOCs are an exact online replica of the offline classroom.

Students do not feel connected to the course and like their belief is shattered from their school and college classroom, that this is going to bring any real benefit to them, it is shattered again with these MOOCS.

In online learning systems, a course built on standard persona like those in traditional school and college cannot work, this is the basic premise on which we are building Yearly.

For the students, it is a classic case of once bitten twice shy, and it is because MOOCS have changed only the delivery medium and not antiquated pedagogy.

One way in which online learning learning can be improved is by trying new pedagogy of **Cohorts**, where a sufficient number of courses are personalised to a broad category of students.

>In case of language learning, the connect of the students to the course would happen only when they can connect to the material in a seamless manner with what they have already seen or learnt, and not as an isolated, independent and alien entity, with which they have to start all over again, like they have done in school and colleges with various subjects of theirs.

**A new language cannot be taught like a new subject.**

>Making a student learning new language should be done as building a new layer of learning over another layer of what the student has already learnt. This way there is connect between syntax and semantics and student.

**At yearly we want to build the connect between Student, Syntax and Semantics.**

**Sir Issac** has already amply demonstrated that there is lot of inertia involved in building something from scratch, and it is true for learning a new skill or language.

_For eg: It is always easier to date a stranger if someone can make an introduction of yours to that person. Ah!

>At Yearly, we believe in **Student First!**

A student who is studying computer science for her masters, wants to learn Spanish and we start teaching her in the same manner like we do in traditional teaching, like "A" for "apple" and so and so forth. Well, it is exciting to know what is an "apple" is in Spanish, since there is hardly any connect between an "English Apple" and a "Spanish Apple", which she can make, there is nothing else that she can do than to memorise the stuff and may be console herself that, she is actually indeed learning Spanish.

>Also, what we are trying to tell her that whatever she has learnt in last may be 20 odd years, is use-less, if she wants to learn a new language and she will have to start with the same centuries old process, again!

**What if she could learn Spanish with Computer Science?**
