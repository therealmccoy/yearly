As the MIT-Harvard study on MOOCS (_https://techcrunch.com/2017/01/13/mooc-enrollment-drops-at-harvardx-and-mitx-after-free-certifications-disappear/_) indicate, the biggest reason for the drop in enrolments of students in various MOOCS of EdX is the dis-continuing with the free certificates!

Now this brings to the fore, the question of why such thing happened?

Since time immemorial, at least for last two centuries, since the advent of steam engine led factory era, education is considered nothing more than getting a collecting a degree or certificate, more or less it is reduced to a piece of paper by society.

Everything is fair and nice, if one has obtained that piece of paper, she is on the path to a (so called) bright future. Nobody questions how much mastery she has on the subject, how much creative she really had been with the subjects she studied, or she could even identify herself with those subjects or not?

Mastery, Creativity and Identity is forgotten and all that is asked is for that piece of paper!

If such is the state of affairs, then it is not at all surprising that even people enrolling in MOOCS do not take it as a medium of enhancing their mastery and hence creativity of a subject which they would like to study, and which was so far not available to them by means of access and delivery; but rather one more opportunity of merely collecting degrees and certificates.

And for this the students are not to be blamed, nor the present education system of most of the countries but rather all of us, who have never endeavoured or challenged the status quo.

We still keep exhorting our kids to pass that one more exam, which would bring them to that elusive piece of paper.

We never exhort our kid to put their heart and soul in to the subject of their passion, master it and be creative with it.

Perhaps because we all are part of this rotten education system and saving our kids from this rotten system is impossible, unless the status quo is challenged.

MOOCS are no different, because they simply depict the inherent behaviour present in today's education system.

The whole purpose of education is to make a woman or man free again.

But today's education system, makes her a bondage of degrees and certificates. The more the merrier, but still there is no guarantee that whether she would be free or not.

And here I quote J Krishnamurti;
>"To discover, there must be freedom, must there not? If you are bound, weighed down, you cannot go far. How can there be freedom if there is accumulation of any kind? The man who accumulates, whether money or knowledge, can never be free. You may be free from the acquisitiveness of things, but the greed for knowledge is still bondage, it holds you. Is a mind that is tethered to any form of acquisition capable of wandering far and discovering? Is virtue accumulation? Can a mind that is accumulating virtue ever be virtuous? Is not virtue the freedom from becoming? Character may be a bondage too. Virtue can never be a bondage, but all accumulation is."

And thus instead of being free by the light of the education, the person is rather bonded by accumulating those degrees and certificates.

Unless we start respecting deep learning, mastery and one's creativity with even one subject of her passion; rather than the number of degrees or certificates one has, the status quo would remain the same and people would continue to enroll in an offline or online course just for that matter of collecting degrees, rather than deep learning.
