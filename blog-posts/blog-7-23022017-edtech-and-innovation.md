I stumbled on this article today morning - _https://sg.news.yahoo.com/edtech-startups-learning-more-relevant-digital-driven-world-080055388.html_

the article says that, _"many startups have sprung after observing the need for paradigm shift required in education and the reluctance of education system to do so."_

while this has been true, we will have to invert this thought, and look into what do we essentially mean by innovation in education and what necessitates this change?

the second part is also answered by the article, saying that,_"Unfortunately, a widening gap between skills needed by employers and what
education systems are teaching to students makes it difficult for people to meet many jobsâ€™ requirement of critical skills."_

while this is so very true, everywhere in the world, no one is deliberating on what is essentially required to solve this problem and how to solve this problem.

Technology is now essentially thought to be the panacea for all world problems, as one educator has so truly mentioned it is like _"just add water...". Ah, this is the problem, let us solve it by technology!

This **Technology Blindness** is not allowing such simple facts which are evident in front of our eyes.

Why institutions like MIT and Harvard and Caltech produce more scientists and mathematicians? Is it because they employ more technology in education?

Why people still aspire to study at Oxford and Cambridge and London School of Economics?

Is it because their classroom are filled with new gadgets and innovation?

I mean, this blindness is laughable, really!

The great educational institutions have been great because they focussed on the mastery of skills (not collecting degrees and certificates), creativity(instead of rotting, home-works and grade of examination) and identity(merely passing the exam and saying that i learnt the subject, student actually identifies with the subject via deep learning).

And this is the innovation which is required in education rather than any new shiny app.

Whenever we see the need for innovation, we have to look at the fundamentals of problems through the first-principles and the first-principle of education has been pedagogy.

We have so much commercialised the entire education system, it is no more than a factory producing students stamped with certificates and degrees, which has actually no meaning in the real world.

all it matters to the current education system is that more and more students enrolled in their institution, so that they can maximise their earnings. It is a profit making enterprise, trying to make themselves as well-off as possible.

Well, Microeconomics teaches us that life is all about trade-offs, so if the education systems would try to maximise their profits at the cost of the quality of their product which is the student, the quality is bound to suffer.

In a perfectly competitive market, the equilibrium is reached because buyers and sellers both want to maximise their well-off. But education is a perfectly inelastic market, because for the buyers(ie the parents) there is no substitute and hence the demand never varies and education institutions are able to throw away pedagogy from the classroom and able to focus on profits.

It has been Pedagogy v/s Profits!

And this is what all the education startups are doing, they are not innovating at all, but have only found the means of maximising their students intake through use of technology (just like traditional educational system want to increase their admission intake).

So in that case, edtech startups and educational system are no different.

What essentially required is going back to the first principle of education and focussing on pedagogy.

Pedagogy would solve all the problems of education, but very few of us are willing to look at it with from zero.

All we want to do is to figure out ways to, _"just add water..."_

The access to education is to most extent has been solved in most cases, if not all with the initiative of self-help groups and governments in most cases with "Right To Education" in India and "No Child Left Behind" acts in US.

To some extent, the edtech startups have solved the access problem also.

But access has never been the fundamental problem for education. Everyone focussed on it, because building a new school is th emost easiest way to shirk away all the other questions which comes to our mind.

"Access" was a perfect alibi for bureaucrats to shirk away their responsibility.

While building new schools was utmost important, but what happens to factories which produce en-mass products without any thought of design and manufacturing process, is in front of us!

What is the use of giving access to education to all, if it is rotten?

Everyone of us will get rotten!

The problem of "access" has been long way back being solved, any startup which would focus on "access" problem with a new app or a new technology is not going to succeed, because students would find the same monotonous way of pedagogy which they have experienced, in their school and colleges and would delete away the app.

Almost everyone in edtech space is focussed on "Access", "Delivery" and "Content".

While "Access" has been long way solved, Delivery" and "Content" without in-depth change in pedagogy would not help at all.

It is just like copying what has been happening in the schools and colleges since centuries. They have some content from the curriculum and they just deliver it like a feeder used to serve the birds.

Only difference between the way current edtech startup are doing is that, instead of manually delivering the content, they are using videos and apps.

Pedagogy would solve the problem of education and hence this world!

It is time for let teachers and educators to innovate and experiment, then experience what has happened with that experiments and collaborate and then go back again to the drawing board with better experiments unless we solve it.

The innovation which is required in edtech space is a pedagogy heavy approach with technology being an enabler and not the dominant force.

We dont have to look too far back, even in our generation there have been great scientists and mathematicians, who became great by just working with a paper-book, paper and pen, just because some teacher in their class aroused their curiosity, enabling them to master the skill, be creative with it and now they can just identify themselves with the subject!

Time to go back to basics of pedagogy!
