# Blog 1 - 27th Jan 2017 : Which problem to solve?

There are many startups doing great and important work, and by this I am talking about my own country, India.

To make the decision to do a startup is actually very easy.All the successful startups, started with solving a problem which the founders themselves faced or they felt passionately about, so much that they were willing to bet their life on that.

So which problem one should work on?

The way I figured it out in a simple manner, by asking myself **which is the most important problem plaguing this world?**

**So what is the most important problem this world is facing?**

**Chinese have an ancient proverb that the death rises in the gut.**

All malaise of this world has been only due to one problem, the inequality of income or rather the increasing of inequality of income divide.

Every single big problem this world is currently facing can be attributed to it.

The rich tried to become more richer, denied the opportunities to others, oppressed them and now all set of different innocent people are facing the consequences of it.

>All conflicts, violence, hatred, intolerance, poverty,hunger and unhappiness can be attributed to only the growing income divide.

While this is true for individuals, it is true for bigger sets of people also, like countries and this day, as we are witness of epic violent events unfolding in front of our eyes, every day; there is nothing more important topic to deliberate than the growing income divide.

Since now we have recognised the single biggest problem plaguing this planet, the next automatic question is how do we solve this problem?

Well, as a very famous gentleman used to say, it is elementary, my dear !

>The only way to eliminate the income inequality is to increase the income generation opportunities available and enhance the opportunities for whose who are already employed.

So people would say, there are millions of factories all across the globe and several hundred million other employment opportunities, so where is the problem in this.

The problem lies in the fact the under-privileged are so, because of the fact they were not awarded even basic opportunities.

Take for example, in India there are still incidents we hear that people are not allowed to draw water from the community well.If the situation is still so grave after 69 years of independence, then rest of the things may very well be left to imagination.

Raising more factories or business does not mean that automatically the under-privileged can start their employment their, earning more income.

>It does not happen because, their **”employability quotient”** has not increased.

>Hence, it can be easily abstracted that, the most important problem which a startup can solve for this world is to increase the “employability quotient” of the under-privileged and the **”under-employed”**.

_As skill sets rise of under-privileged and ”under-employed”, so does their ”employability quotient”, they get better and higher income jobs and thus the income inequality starts reducing._

>English is the defacto commercial language of the world, and if one has to increase its employability quotient it is imperative that she should be able to communicative effectively in through written and spoken English.

And the power of changing life through increasing people’s ”employability quotient” is not something imaginary. It is something which I have experienced first hand and have observed the power of it.

In one of the ventures that I ran in 2012, I recruited a security guard of a bank, as a delivery person. Slowly and steadily, after observing his dedication, sincerity and discipline, I started teaching him various other things, like operating a computer and email. He soon started working on Google Docs and even updating data, live on the data-base, via PhPMyAdmin.

Acquisition of these new fold skills, increased his ”employability quotient” many times. After my venture shut down, I drafted his CV , incorporating it with the newly acquired skills by him and just briefly instructed him how to answer the questions in interview, related to his skill. Within just two days, he got a job of an executive at a construction company, with monthly income, 50% more than what I was paying him. Within six months, with his inherent good work, he got another 25% raise. Later on, his employer bought a piece of land for him, from the company money, as a tool of retention, and asked him to pay by monthly installment ,via his monthly income.

From a security guard, which he has been for past eight years, he became owner of a piece of land in Pune district and increased his monthly income also, more than 150% in less than a year.

The skill which he acquired, along with his strong character traits, enabled him to change his life and his direct dependent, two kids and his wife. His kids can now go to better school and can have a better future.

Hence, it was very easy decision to work on this problem.

This is an adventurous expedition, which was too difficult to resist for me.
