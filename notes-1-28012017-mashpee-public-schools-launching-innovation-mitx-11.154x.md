1. All students to engage and participate actively in the class.

2. Less teacher talk and more engagement.

    _self-1: how to replicate the points 1 and 2 in an online classroom?_

3. To identify kids when they are having a hard time, before they fall behind?

4. Attendance, graduation rates (could be course completion rate), test-scores and drop-out rates.

     _self-2: designing an algorithm which takes other parameters, along with those in (4) and then becomes a course success yardstick. probably on a scale of 1 to 5._

5. all students should have the opportunity to learn and be successful.

    _self-3: probably identifying what worked for successful students and then focussing attention on other students in real time, with those attributes. particularly a challenge in online learning where the connections between instructor and students are so weak and the course is of shorter durations, and also the number of students is huge (which could be a boon or bane, depending on the way you take it)

6. a teacher should always be viewing the course content and the presentation from the perspective of a learner.

    _self-4: with a much wider demography, how do we ensure that this happens in online learning?_

7. before the course is freezed and formatted, there should be a picture built of how the student would look like, after she successfully finishes the course?

    _self-5: the course should start with the end goal in mind, in a holistic sense. it should not only about how much the student has been able to learn, but how how much she is able to put in practice also. what is the use of knowledge, which cannot be put to use? so how do we identify those parameters in the first place, which could help us in evaluating successfully and sustainably that the knowledge is being actually put to use, by the student, who successfully finished the course?_

    _self-6: how to onboard a student who has been far left behind since her school or college days of traditional learning, back to the culture of learning, within the short duration and the limited time, which could be afforded during the course?
